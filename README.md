# Octopus
Stylindex Component Library

## Using fonts and styles

Fonts are currently hosted on our static assets url (see src/css/fonts.css). These fonts, and additional CSS can be used by simply importing `@stylindex/octopus/fonts.css` at the top level of your application, providing you have [css-loading](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/) in your build pipeline.
